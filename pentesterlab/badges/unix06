Logging in
In this challenge, you can log in using the username pentesterlab and the password pentesterlab.

In the previous challenge, we checked te .bashrc and found an alias that contained the key. 
In this challenge, the key is defined in an environment variable using the export command. 
This will allow the user to type $PTLAB_KEY instead of the key every time they need to use the key.


The purpose of a .bashrc file is to provide a place where you can set up variables, 
functions and aliases, define your (PS1) prompt and define other settings 
that you want to use every time you open a new terminal window.

grep -v
-- takes input line by line, and outputs only the lines in which grep does not appear. 

find /home .bashrc -exec grep export {} \; | grep -v GCC_COLORS
-- find /home .bashrc -> 
                            /home/victim28
                            /home/victim28/.bash_logout
                            /home/victim28/.profile
                            /home/victim28/.bashrc
                            /home/victim20
                            /home/victim20/.bash_logout
                            /home/victim20/.profile
                            /home/victim20/.bashrc
-- then sends output to grep
-- then, for each line of output, grep 'export' 
-- \; defines the end of exec command
-- find {} list recursively to filename

If you run find with exec, {} expands to the filename of each file or directory found with find 
(so that ls in your example gets every found filename as an argument 
- note that it calls ls or whatever other command you specify once for each file found).

Semicolon ; ends the command executed by exec. It needs to be escaped with \ so that the shell you run find inside does not treat it as its own special character, but rather passes it to find.
